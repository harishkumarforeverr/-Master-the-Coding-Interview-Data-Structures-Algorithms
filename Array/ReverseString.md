```javascript
function reverse(str) {
  if (!str || typeof str != "string" || str.length < 2) return str;

  const backwards = [];
  const totalItems = str.length - 1;
  for (let i = totalItems; i >= 0; i--) {
    backwards.push(str[i]);
  }
  return backwards.join("");
}

function reverse2(str) {
  //check for valid input
  return str.split("").reverse().join("");
}

const reverse3 = (str) => [...str].reverse().join("");

reverse("Timbits Hi");
reverse2("Timbits Hi");
reverse3("Timbits Hi");
```

as per my knowledage

1. reverse time complexcity = 0(n)
2. reverse2 time complexcity = 0(n^3)
3. reverse3 time complexcity = 0(n^3)

Let's break down the operations in `reverse2` and `reverse3` to understand their time complexities:

1. `reverse1` function:

Time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because it iterates through the string once.

2. `reverse2` function:

   - `str.split('')`: This operation splits the input string into an array of characters. The time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
   - `reverse()`: Reversing an array using the `reverse()` method has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
   - `join('')`: Joining the array back into a string also has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
   - Combining these operations, we have O(n) + O(n) + O(n), which simplifies to O(n).

3. `reverse3` function:
   - `[...str]`: This operation spreads the input string into an array of characters. The time complexity of this operation is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
   - `reverse()`: Reversing an array has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
   - `join('')`: Joining the reversed array back into a string also has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
   - Combining these operations, we have O(n) + O(n) + O(n), which simplifies to O(n).

In both cases, the dominant operation is iterating over the input string or array, which has a linear time complexity of O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity of both `reverse2` and `reverse3` functions is linear, O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
