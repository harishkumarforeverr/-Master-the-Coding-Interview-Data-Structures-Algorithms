The time complexity of breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) for tree traversal is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because both algorithms must visit every node in the tree.

For BFS, the space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case scenario, all nodes may need to be stored in the queue.

For DFS, the space complexity depends on the implementation. In a recursive implementation, the space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In an iterative implementation using a stack, the space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case scenario.

Overall, these complexities indicate that both BFS and DFS are efficient algorithms for traversing trees, with BFS typically being more memory-intensive due to its use of a queue, while DFS can be more memory-efficient when implemented iteratively.
