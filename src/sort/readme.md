Stability in sorting algorithms refers to preserving the relative order of elements with equal keys. For instance, in a stable sort, if two elements have the same key, their order in the sorted output will be the same as their order in the original input.

Example:
Consider sorting a list of students' exam scores. If two students have the same score, a stable sort algorithm ensures that their original order in the list is maintained in the sorted output.

In contrast, an unstable sort algorithm may rearrange the order of elements with equal keys, resulting in a different output order.

Stability is important because it allows for predictable behavior, especially when sorting by multiple criteria or when preserving the original order of elements is desired.
