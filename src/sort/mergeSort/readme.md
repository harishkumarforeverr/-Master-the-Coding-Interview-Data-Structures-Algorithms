### Complexity Analysis:

- **Divide Step**: Each recursive call divides the array into two equal halves, which takes O(logn) time.

- **Conquer & Combine Step**: Merging two sorted arrays of length n takes O(n) time. Since there are logn levels of recursion and each level requires O(n) time for merging, the total time complexity is O(nlogn).

### Conclusion:

In summary, O(nlogn) complexity, as seen in algorithms like merge sort, indicates a highly efficient algorithm for sorting and other operations on large datasets. It balances the trade-off between the efficiency gained from dividing the problem into smaller parts and the overhead of combining the solutions back together.
