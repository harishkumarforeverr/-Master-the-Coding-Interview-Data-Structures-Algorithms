Here's a brief explanation of AVL trees in a concise way:

AVL trees are a type of self-balancing binary search tree. They are designed to maintain a balanced state, where the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most 1. This balancing property ensures that AVL trees have logarithmic time complexity for operations like insertion, deletion, and search, which makes them efficient for many use cases.

To maintain the balance, AVL trees perform rotations when a node's subtrees become unbalanced after an insertion or deletion. The rotations (single or double) rearrange the nodes in the tree, while preserving the binary search tree property.

The key aspects of AVL trees are:

1. Balance Factor: The difference between the heights of the left and right subtrees of a node. It can be -1, 0, or 1 for a balanced AVL tree.
2. Rotations: When the balance factor of a node becomes -2 or 2 (implying an unbalanced state), rotations (single or double) are performed to restore the balance.
3. Time Complexity: All operations (insertion, deletion, search) have a time complexity of O(log n) in the average case, due to the balanced nature of the tree.

AVL trees provide efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations, making them suitable for applications that require frequent modifications to the data structure while maintaining a balanced state.
